<!-- Hi, I'm Fauzi, a web developer based in Asia. Currently, I'm working on an open-source platform for artists called ([Upy](https://github.com/upydotmoe)). We recognize that many popular platforms, such as Pixiv, DeviantArt, and Artstation, have left many artists disappointed by allowing AI-generated images on their platform. That's why we are here to offer an alternative that supports and encourages human creativity.

Unlike other platforms, Upy strictly prohibits AI-generated images. We are committed to upholding the value of human creativity and ensuring that artists can showcase their unique talents and abilities. Our mission is to provide a safe and inclusive space for artists to express themselves and connect with others in the community.

If you like what we do you can help us by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/upydotmoe) the project or you can also contribute to the project. Your sponsorship helps our project stay active and grow even better, every sponsorship means a lot to us.
