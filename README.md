<!-- Hi, I'm Fauzi, a web developer based in Asia. Currently, I'm working on an open-source platform for artists called ([Upy](https://github.com/upydotmoe)). We recognize that many popular platforms, such as Pixiv, DeviantArt, and Artstation, have left many artists disappointed by allowing AI-generated images on their platform. That's why we are here to offer an alternative that supports and encourages human creativity.

Unlike other platforms, Upy strictly prohibits AI-generated images. We are committed to upholding the value of human creativity and ensuring that artists can showcase their unique talents and abilities. Our mission is to provide a safe and inclusive space for artists to express themselves and connect with others in the community.

If you like what we do you can help us by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/upydotmoe) the project or you can also contribute to the project. Your sponsorship helps our project stay active and grow even better, every sponsorship means a lot to us.

### > Personal Projects
- **[Upy](https://github.com/upydotmoe)** - An art-sharing platform for Artists that is free from AI-generated content.
  <br>It's currently in hibernate mode because it lacks public support, and of course, I can't maintain it alone. If you want to help me revive this platform, feel free to support me and send me a message to my **[X/Twitter](https://x.com/nor1c_)** or consider sponsoring it => **[Sponsor Upy](https://github.com/sponsors/upydotmoe)**.

### > Community Contributions
- **[vue-tagsinput](https://github.com/nor1c/vue-tagsinput)**
  <br><br>**Motivation:** I was working on one of my personal projects, and then I found a helpful library, but sadly it's not maintained anymore, a.k.a abandoned by the creator/maintainer, and at times it doesn't work for the latest Vue version, so I decided to fix that major issue and other minor issues that have been ignored for a long time. Also, I added some new features to make it better.
  
  - Added support for Vue 3
  - Migrated to Vite
  - Fixed major and minor issues
  - Added some new minor features
